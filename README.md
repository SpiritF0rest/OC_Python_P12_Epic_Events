### :wrench: Installation :wrench:
***
Prerequisites: Docker, Python, Poetry, Sentry
***
In your directory for the project:

Clone repository from:
- [Epic Events](https://github.com/SpiritF0rest/OC_Python_P12_Epic_Events)

#### :wrench: Virtual environment and modules :wrench:

```
To install modules:
$ poetry install

To active the virtual environment (Linux):
$ source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate

To active the virtual environment (Windows Powershell):
$ & ((poetry env info --path) + "\Scripts\activate.ps1")

To deactive the virtual environment: 
$ deactivate
```

#### :whale2: Docker :whale2:

```
To pull postgres image:
$ docker pull postgres

To create and run the Postgres container:
$ docker run --name ee-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={your_password} -e POSTGRES_DB={DB_name} -d postgres

Ensure that the Postgres container is built and currently executing:
$ docker ps
```

#### :wrench: Dotenv :wrench:

```
Copy the .env.example in a .env file and fill with the correct data:
DB_URL : be careful that it matches what you put when creating the docker container
FIRST_USER_* : the first manager who will be responsible for creating the first users
```
Now, you can use the app :tada:

### :keyboard: Basic use and commands :keyboard:
***
```
First use, init the database (your container is running, .env is filled, the modules are installed and the environment is activated):
$ poetry run python epic_events/database.py

All commands start with:
$ python3 -m epic_events

If you need help to find a main command:
$ python3 -m epic_events --help

If you need help to find a secondary command, example: 
$ python3 -m epic_events client --help

To connect you:
$ python3 -m epic_events auth login -e {your_email}

To know what the options are for a command (when you're connected), example:
$ python3 -m epic_events contract create --help

To disconnect you:
$ python3 -m epic_events auth logout    
```

### :newspaper: Tests :newspaper:
***
```
To test:
$ pytest

To generate Flake 8 report:
$ flake8

To see coverage:
$ coverage run -m pytest
$ coverage report
$ coverage html
```

### :eyes: Sentry :eyes:

On sentry you will find unexpected errors. And also information logs when a user is created or modified and a contract is signed
